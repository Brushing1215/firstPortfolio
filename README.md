# firstPortfolio
In this project I made a portfolio about myself. I included several images and descriptions.
In this Portfolio you will find the following:
    Functional, deployed application


    GitHub repository with README describing the project


    Navbar that is consistent on each page.


    Navbar on each page that contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.


    All links are working.


    Must use semantic html.


    Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)


    Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)


    Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
